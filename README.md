A minimal starting point for projects using Claude Code assistance. This template focuses on building a flexible, learner-focused development experience without making assumptions about specific technologies or implementations.

## How to Use This Template

1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Start a new Claude Code session
3. Let Claude guide you through the project discovery process:
   - What you want to build
   - What you want to learn
   - How you prefer to learn
   - What technologies you'd like to use

## Key File

- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)**: Guides Claude on how to start a project with you, focusing on discovery, learning, and incremental development

## Project Philosophy

This template is deliberately minimal to avoid making assumptions about your project. Each time you start a new project, you can adapt your approach based on current best practices and improved AI capabilities.

The focus is on:
- Learning through building
- Incremental development
- Regular commits with clear explanations
- Flexibility in technology choices
- Optimizing the collaboration between you and Claude
