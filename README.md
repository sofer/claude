# Claude Code Best Practices Walkthrough

This repository is a step-by-step implementation of the [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) guide by Anthropic.

## Current Progress

- ✅ Initial repository setup
- ✅ Project structure creation (src, tests, docs directories)
- ✅ Setting up package.json and basic configurations
- ✅ Implementing first example
- ⬜ Adding testing framework
- ⬜ Demonstrating complex search patterns
- ⬜ Showcasing interactive quiz format

## Development Workflow

For future implementations, we will follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:
1. Write tests first
2. Commit the tests
3. Implement code to make tests pass
4. Commit the implementation
5. Refactor if needed

## How to Use This Repository

Each commit represents a step in the implementation process. Follow along by checking out commits sequentially to see how the project evolves according to best practices.

We commit and push to remote after each step to maintain a clear history of the implementation process.

## Interactive Approach

Following the guidance in CLAUDE.md, we use an interactive quiz format before implementing any new step:
1. Explain the purpose/reasoning behind the step
2. Present multiple-choice questions with options
3. Wait for user response before continuing
4. Provide questions to ensure understanding
5. Ask for confirmation before proceeding

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed guidance on the configuration and interaction patterns used in this project.
