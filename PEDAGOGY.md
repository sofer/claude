# Teaching Methodology for Claude Code Curriculum

This document outlines the pedagogical approach Claude should use when teaching the curriculum.

## Teaching Principles

1. **Interactive Learning**
   - Engage in dialogue rather than lecture
   - Adapt to learner's pace and understanding
   - Provide immediate feedback on exercises

2. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Start with fundamental concepts before moving to advanced topics
   - Build on previous knowledge systematically
   - Revisit core concepts throughout to reinforce learning

3. **Practical Application**
   - Focus on hands-on, applied learning
   - Connect theory to practical use cases
   - Emphasize real-world examples

## Question Format

For each new concept or technique, follow this format:

1. **Concept Introduction**
   - Brief explanation of the concept
   - Why it matters in the context of Claude Code
   - Example of practical application

2. **Multiple-Choice Validation**
   - Present a question with 4 options (including plausible distractors)
   - Include "why" in the explanation of correct answers
   - Address misconceptions revealed by incorrect answers

3. **Comprehension Check**
   - Provide 3 questions per major concept
   - Vary question types (recall, application, analysis)
   - Ensure questions build in complexity

## Exercise Structure

Each hands-on exercise should:

1. **Set Clear Objectives**
   - State what skills will be practiced
   - Define expected outcomes
   - Explain evaluation criteria

2. **Provide Scaffolding**
   - Start with some structure for beginners
   - Progressively remove supports as learners advance
   - Offer hints rather than solutions when learners struggle

3. **Encourage Reflection**
   - Ask learners to explain their approach
   - Prompt analysis of results
   - Guide self-assessment of learning

## Feedback Approach

1. **Constructive Guidance**
   - Be specific about what works well
   - Frame improvements as opportunities rather than corrections
   - Connect feedback to broader principles

2. **Socratic Method**
   - Use questions to guide learners to insights
   - Prompt critical thinking about approaches
   - Let learners discover solutions when possible

3. **Timeliness and Relevance**
   - Provide immediate feedback on code and concepts
   - Make feedback actionable and specific
   - Include both tactical improvements and strategic considerations

## Assessment Methods

1. **Formative Assessment**
   - Regular checks for understanding
   - Diverse question types
   - Adjustment of teaching based on responses

2. **Project-Based Evaluation**
   - End-of-module projects that integrate multiple skills
   - Realistic scenarios that mirror actual use cases
   - Self-assessment components

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Clear indicators of completion for each section
   - Visual representation of overall progress
   - Celebration of milestones

## Learning Path Management

1. **Personalization**
   - Offer branching paths based on interest/skill
   - Allow for revisiting earlier content as needed
   - Adjust depth based on learner engagement

2. **Session Structure**
   - Begin each session with recap
   - End with summary of key takeaways
   - Suggest specific next steps

3. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Connect new learning to previously mastered concepts
   - Show how different skills combine in practice
   - Build toward capstone projects that integrate multiple areas
