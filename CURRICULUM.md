# Claude Code Curriculum

This curriculum outlines what to learn to master Claude Code following Anthropic's best practices. It defines the learning objectives, content modules, and progression path.

> **Note**: For information on how this curriculum should be taught, see [PEDAGOGY.md](./PEDAGOGY.md)

## Module 1: Foundations

### Lesson 1: Setup and Getting Started
- **Objective**: Understand Claude Code fundamentals and set up a productive workflow
- **Task**: 
  - Create a `.clauderc` or `CLAUDE.md` file with project-specific context
  - Set up basic project structure with source and test directories
  - Establish workflow for committing and pushing changes
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Set up a project from scratch that follows best practices

### Lesson 2: Context and Specificity
- **Objective**: Learn to provide appropriate context and specific instructions
- **Task**:
  - Practice different query formulations 
  - Learn when to be specific vs. when to be open-ended
  - Understand how Claude interprets your requests
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Ask Claude to implement the same feature with different levels of specificity

## Module 2: Core Workflows

### Lesson 3: Explore, Plan, Code, Commit
- **Objective**: Master the primary recommended workflow
- **Task**:
  - Use Claude to explore a codebase
  - Create a plan for implementing a feature
  - Implement the feature with Claude's help
  - Create well-structured commits
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Add a new feature following this workflow

### Lesson 4: Test-Driven Development
- **Objective**: Apply TDD principles with Claude Code
- **Task**:
  - Write tests first, commit them
  - Ask Claude to implement code to make tests pass
  - Refactor the implementation with Claude
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Implement a utility function using TDD

## Module 3: Advanced Techniques

### Lesson 5: Visual Design Implementation
- **Objective**: Learn to use visual references effectively
- **Task**:
  - Provide screenshots or design references
  - Translate designs into code with Claude
  - Iterate on implementation based on feedback
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Implement a simple UI component from a screenshot

### Lesson 6: Complex Code Architecture
- **Objective**: Use Claude for larger architectural tasks
- **Task**:
  - Learn to describe system architecture
  - Break down large tasks into manageable pieces
  - Implement complex features across multiple files
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Design and implement a small system with multiple components

## Module 4: Optimization and Best Practices

### Lesson 7: Iterative Improvement
- **Objective**: Learn patterns for ongoing improvement
- **Task**:
  - Use course correction techniques
  - Implement feedback loops
  - Iterate on implementations until they meet requirements
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Refine an existing feature through multiple iterations

### Lesson 8: Project Management
- **Objective**: Use Claude for broader project tasks
- **Task**:
  - Generate documentation
  - Create pull requests with Claude
  - Review code with Claude's help
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Document and create a PR for a completed feature

## Final Project

Apply all learned techniques to implement a complete feature in your codebase:
1. Setup context and project configuration
2. Follow TDD approach
3. Implement feature with appropriate architecture
4. Document thoroughly
5. Create a well-structured PR
